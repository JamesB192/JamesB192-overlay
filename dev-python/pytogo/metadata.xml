pytogo is a fast, crude, incomplete Python-to-Go translator meant to
assist a human programmer in translating large volumes of Python to
idiomatic Go, preserving comments and structure. It does the
mechanical things that are easy for software but hard for humans,
leaving a human free to concentrate on the hard parts like type
annotations.

It exists because at the time it was written the only automated
translators available either produced rather horrifying generated Go
or wouldn't translate standalone Python code to standalone Go.

It is conservative, never actually throwing away information from
the input Python. It assumes its Python input is well-formed, and
can fail on inputs that are sufficiently weird.
